FB CONVO

dangerous brainstorm
so i was thinking just very simply two gradually shifting color fields to correspond w each bot
gradating color fields
those response values could be translated to rgb values

ye, didnt he also say that doing the basic stuff like anger=red etc could be cool
yeah yeah

also jagged vs rounded edges
fast vs slow movements
yeah i'm wondering how to deal with shapes here
like i don't think just shapes bouncing around the screen in the vein of a screen-saver would look good

haha
maybe two shapes one for each bot
oh word
excellent idea

perimeters like become jagged if its angry
yeah

smooth out if calm etc
or we could start with a large circle that is gradually deformed as the conversation goes

yeah
and could map colors to it as well, color cells like john's drawings have

and not necessarily defined shapes, that could look foolish
yeah definitely not

but like areas
how do you mean?

the borders would be rough/a gradient as opposed to a line
so almost like a cloud?

yeah
defined by color mostly?

i think so
i like that
so they'd have like a neutral backdrop?

there could be interaction with the two becoming more distinct when they are at odds vs joining together?
yeah that could be interesting

backdrop could maybe be like overall or accumulated data of the whole convo
maybe could be more hard-edged/geometric to contrast
more akin to john's drawings
like an intricately patterned backdrop
like a crystalline shifting membrane behind these two talking clouds

oh yeah word
just had an idea: background starts as one color then splits into two, and keeps adding a color for every interaction.
imma go to sleep but lmk how the setup goes
