# Idea Sheet

#### Brainstorm: April 18, 2017

### Shapes
- Two gradually shifting, gradating color fields to correspond with each bot

- response values could be translated to rgb values, start with basic stuff like anger=red etc

- jagged vs rounded edges, fast vs slow movements

- how to deal with shapes? like I don't think just shapes bouncing around the screen in the vein of a screen-saver would look good

- maybe two shapes one for each bot

- perimeters like become jagged if its angry, smooth out if calm

- or we could start with a large circle that is gradually deformed as the conversation goes

- could map colors to it as well, color cells like john's drawings have

- and not necessarily defined shapes, that could look foolish, more like areas where the borders would be rough/a gradient as opposed to a line - like a cloud, defined by color

### Background

- there could be interaction with the two becoming more distinct when they are at odds vs joining together

- backdrop could maybe be like overall or accumulated data of the whole convo
- maybe could be more hard-edged/geometric to contrast
more akin to john's drawings
- like an intricately patterned backdrop
like a crystalline shifting membrane behind these two talking clouds: [Like this?](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/blowing-bubbles-in-chocolate-milk-with-straw-on-royalty-free-image/652957337?esource=SEO_GIS_CDN_Redirect)


- background starts as one color then splits into two, and keeps adding a color for every interaction.
